# Task Overview
You are maintaining an ecommerce backend built with FastAPI. Recent changes to the authentication logic have caused all user login attempts to fail with an Unauthorized error, even with correct credentials. As a result, no users can log in or access protected resources. Your responsibility is to quickly identify and resolve the core authentication problem so users can authenticate and receive tokens again.

# Guidance
- Focus your debugging and fixes on the authentication flow and its dependencies
- Do not change unrelated API endpoints or their structure
- Check how the authentication dependency and login machinery work together
- Consider interactions between token creation, validation, and route protection

# Objectives
- Ensure valid users can successfully log in and receive an access token
- Allow access to protected routes for authenticated users
- Maintain the existing endpoint and router organization

# How to Verify
- Attempt to log in using valid credentials on the /login endpoint; a valid access token should be returned
- Use the received access token to access a protected endpoint (such as /users/me) and verify access is granted
- Ensure that invalid logins are still properly rejected with an appropriate error response
